## About the Workshop

New technical forms of deception–including AI deepfakes and unethical uses of ChatGTP–have gained attention in the wider research community and media. There has also been an increase in the coordinated social activities of bad actors posing as legitimate human research participants. People, for example, sign up for online HCI studies by misrepresenting their identities and experiences. This workshop explores what counts as "fraud" in the rapidly changing sociotechnical landscape of qualitative HCI research sites, and how might our community better understand (and strategically handle) new forms of fraudulence in human-centered design. Researchers across academia and industry are invited to participate in this discourse, share their personal experiences, explore potential strategies to combat fraudulence and reflect critically on the efficacies and shortcomings of such strategies. Outcomes of this workshop include working towards better guidelines, forming a community of researchers to support those impacted by fraudulence, and collaboratively defining a research agenda based on workshop discussions.
