## Submission guidelines
We encourage submissions that share or unpack researcher's personal experiences with fraudulence, explore potential strategies to combat fraudulence, and reflect critically on
the efficacies and shortcomings of such strategies. Submissions should use the the ACM single-column Word or LaTeX [template](https://chi2024.acm.org/submission-guides/chi-publication-formats/), and not exceed 8 pages (including references). There is no minimum page requirement, but we ask that case study submissions include sufficient context on the research study, how fraudulence was observed, and how it was addressed (if applicable) to make their experiences understandable to a broad audience. To make a submission, please [use this google form](https://forms.gle/u2egyAo4wjZMNS6QA). Any sensitive information may be anonymized as the researcher sees fit.

## Permissions for sharing post-workshop outcomes on workshop website
Author list and affiliations are not anonymized for case study submission and the review process. However, post completion of the workshop, we intend to make available on our workshop website all submissions as a collective guide of fraudulent encounters. If researchers wish to participate in this step but would like their name and institution anonymized, please indicate so on the Google form as a note.
