## Call for Participation
We invite interested researchers to submit, in a case-study format, a narrative of their experiences with fraudulence, the challenges, lessons learned, and questions they have moving forward. Templates can be found on the [workshop website]. Submissions should not exceed 1,000 words and can be emailed to fraud-in-hci@gmail.com. 
Acceptances will be based on the quality of the submission and the diversity of experiences. 
At least one author of each accepted submission must attend the workshop and all participants must register for both the workshop and for at least one day of the conference. We encourage case-study submissions that, but are not limited to: 
- Explore varied and emerging forms of human/nonhuman fraudulence 
- Critically reflect how we define and talk about "fraud" in HCI 
- Unpack fraud in relation to the diversity of qualitative research practice in HCI 
- Detail experiences with fraud from a particular methodological/theoretical perspective
- Reflect on fraud from the researcherâ€™s perspective (eg., researcher well-being)

During the workshop, attendees will engage in thinking exercises, mapping activities, in-depth discussions, and interactive panels to share and discuss questions, concerns, and proposed strategies. The outcomes of the workshop include (1) a collaboratively defined new research agenda, published as scholarly and public-accessible articles, and (2) a live and interactive casebook of fraudulent encounters that serves as collective practical guides for HCI researchers.
