## Submission guidelines
Submissions should use the the [ACM single-column](https://chi2024.acm.org/submission-guides/chi-publication-formats/) Word or LaTeX template, and not exceed 8 pages (including references). There is no minimum page requirement, but we ask that case study submissions include sufficient context on the research study, how fraudulence was observed, and how it was addressed (if applicable) to make the experience understandable to a broad audience. Sensitive information regarding the research study or participant may be anonymized in the submission as the researcher sees fit. To submit a case study, please [use this google form](https://forms.gle/u2egyAo4wjZMNS6QA). Additionally, note that the Google Form requires the contact author to be signed-in as it is collecting emails to map with the submission. 

## Permissions for sharing post-workshop outcomes on workshop website
Author list and affiliations are not anonymized for case study submission and the review process. However, post completion of the workshop, we intend to make available on our workshop website all submissions as a collective guide of fraudulent encounters. If researchers wish to participate in this step but would like their name and institution anonymized, please indicate so on the Google form as a note.
